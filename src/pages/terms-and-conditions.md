title: TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF TRADE
---

**These contractual conditions apply to the Services provided by GGL AUSTRALIA LOGISTICS PTY LTD.**
These Trading Conditions contain exclusions of liability and indemnities in favour of GGL AUSTRALIA LOGISTICS PTY LTD.
You should read these Trading Conditions carefully.

### While you should read the whole document, we draw your attention to the following clauses:

**Subcontracting** – We may subcontract the performance of the services and our subcontractors will have the benefit of these terms and conditions. When subcontracting we will select the liability level that produces the lowest rates.

**Liability Exclusions - Carriage of Goods** – In respect of international carriage of goods, under clause 10 liability is limited to the maximum extent permitted under international conventions. It is likely that if goods are damaged, the liability limits will not fully cover the loss. It is strongly recommended that you obtain insurance to cover loss or damage to the goods.

**Liability Exclusions – General** – Clause 10 contains a number of clauses that limit our liability more generally in respect of the services.

**Time limit for claims** – Clauses 10.11 – 10.12 set out strict time limits on making claims against us. You should notify us immediately if you wish to make a claim against us.

**Indemnities** – Clause 11 sets out a number of instances where you are required to pay us for loss or damage that we incur in providing the services. Sometimes these costs will not be your fault, such as if a Government inspection delays the release of the goods and storage charges are incurred.

**Lien** – Clause 13 gives us the right to hold your goods and sell them if you do not pay our fees.

**Security Interest** – Under clause 14 you grant us a registerable security interest in the goods for payment of all amounts you owe us under this contract.

**Fee increases** – Under clause 6 we can increase our fees if the amount charged by subcontractors or other third parties changes and we did not know of, or could not have prevented, that cost increase.

**Disposal of goods** – Clause 15 sets out where we can dispose of uncollected goods. In most instances we have to notify you before disposing of any goods.
